## Code TODO
- [x] Image collection from server (Done by Prathamesh)
- [ ] Training data generation (in progress, need to work together)
  - [ ] Finding font
  - [ ] Finding symbolset
  - [ ] Enabling transformations (maybe make image text not slanted)
- [ ] Model training
  - [ ] Training time doesn't take forever
  - [ ] Accuracy value is good
  - [ ] Loss value is good
- [ ] Classification
  - [ ] High contrast images to improve correct predictions
  - [ ] Make images horizontal (find library to make text in images not slanted, same as training data)
  - [ ] Get good accuracy
  - [ ] Get into .CSV format for Submitty (in the right encoding)

  ## Other deliverables TODO
- [ ] 3 minute video
  - [ ] What approaches did you adopt to the file access and retrieval task.  What problems did you encounter?  How did you go about addressing them?
  - [ ] What approaches did you adopt to the captcha solving task.  What problems did you encounter?  How did you go about addressing them?
  - [ ] Itemize and describe, in sufficent convincing detail, the nature and detail of the activities and work you completed entirely on your Pi,
  - [ ] What other lessons did you learn completing Project 2 that it might benefit your colleagues to know about?
- [ ] Summary details of your file retrieval
  - [ ] Summary details of your preparation/pre processing 
  - [ ] Summary details on your training set creation 
  - [ ] Summary validation set details; submitty solving/solution file generation summary.
