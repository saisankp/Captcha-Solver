## TODO
- [x] Image collection from server (Done by Prathamesh)
- [ ] Training data generation (in progress, need to work together)
  - [ ] Finding font
  - [ ] Finding symbolset
  - [ ] Enabling transformations (maybe make image text not slanted)
- [ ] Model training
  - [ ] Training time doesn't take forever
  - [ ] Accuracy value is good
  - [ ] Loss value is good
- [ ] Classification
  - [ ] High contrast images to improve correct predictions
  - [ ] Make images horizontal (find library to make text in images not slanted, same as training data)
  - [ ] Get good accuracy
